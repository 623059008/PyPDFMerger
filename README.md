## Problem Solving

1. Make sure you are using python3.x
2. > ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_tkinter'

    It's because when you install python3, you didn't choose with tk.
    See more about [how to install tk](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5459444/tkinter-python-may-not-be-configured-for-tk)

    For Mac OS
    ```shell
    brew install python-tk
    ```

    For Ubuntu
    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install python-tk python3-tk tk-dev
    ```

    For Windows: Reinsall your python3 and make sure choose tk-tools(just check everything related to tk lib)
